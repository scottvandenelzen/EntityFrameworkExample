MSSE680 Entity Framework Example

This is a very simple Entity Framework example.

I took this from http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/363040/An-Introduction-to-Entity-Framework-for-Absolute-B and updated it to Visual Studio 2012.

You'll note it has a Data Provider Layer and then an application layer.  Eventually your application will also need a business layer as well.

I'm assuming you're running SQL Server 2012.  The build script DatabaseCreateScript.sql will create your database and one table to use this example.
